# CKA-Core-#2: Pods Crash, ReplicaSets Recover, Deployments Orchestrate

Let’s continue the CKA journey. This time, we break down three building blocks of workload management in Kubernetes — **Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments** — and understand why they exist together, not in isolation.

## 🔹 What is a Pod?

A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, wrapping one or more containers that share storage, network, and lifecycle.  
While a Pod can have multiple containers, we typically stick to **one container per Pod** for simplicity.

❗ **Problem:**  
If a Pod crashes or the node fails, Kubernetes won’t recreate it unless managed by another controller.

### 🛠️ YAML Hack – Generate Pod YAML via CLI

```bash
kubectl run mypod --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml
