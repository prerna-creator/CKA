Kubernetes architecture consists of two primary types of nodes:
Control Plane (Master Node)
Worker Nodes

Let’s break down the components and their workflows.

🧠 Control Plane Components
These components manage and maintain the entire cluster’s state.
API Server:
The first point of contact for any request in Kubernetes.
Acts as the central gateway for communication between components.
Only the API Server has direct access to etcd; no other component talks to it directly.
ETCD:
A distributed, consistent key-value store.
Stores the entire cluster state, including nodes, pods, configs, and secrets.
Controller Manager:
Runs background reconciliation loops to ensure the actual state matches the desired state.
Includes various controllers like Deployment, ReplicaSet, and Node Controller.
Scheduler:
Scans for unscheduled pods.
Assigns them to the best-fit worker node based on resources and constraints.

🔁 Control Plane Workflow
A user (or automation tool) submits a request using kubectl, which goes to the API Server.
The API Server authenticates and validates the request, and updates etcd with the desired state.
The Scheduler assigns unscheduled pods to appropriate nodes.
The Controller Manager ensures the cluster continuously matches the desired state (scaling, healing, etc.).
All interactions with etcd happen only through the API Server.

💪 Worker Node Components 
These nodes are responsible for running application workloads.They are the execution muscle of the cluster.
kubelet:
Communicates with the API Server to receive pod definitions.
Ensures the containers are running as described.
kube-proxy:
Manages networking rules.
Facilitates communication between pods and services across the cluster.
Container Runtime:
Pulls images and starts containers.
Examples include containerd, CRI-O (Docker is deprecated in newer Kubernetes versions).

🔁 Worker Node Workflow 
Once a pod is scheduled, the API Server notifies the kubelet on the assigned node.
The kubelet pulls the image using the container runtime and starts the pod.
Pod status and health are continuously reported back to the API Server.
kube-proxy ensures proper routing and communication for the pod.

🎯 Final Thought
Think of the Control Plane as the brain🧠 of your cluster, making all the decisions, storing the desired state, and orchestrating behaviour.
Meanwhile, the Worker Nodes are the muscle💪 executing tasks, running containers, and serving the actual workloads.
